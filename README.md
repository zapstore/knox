## Install

To install, run the install script:

```sh
curl https://dl.soapbox.pub/install/knox.sh | sh
```

This will download the latest version of `knox` and install it to `/usr/local/bin`.
Linux, MacOS, and Windows are supported.

### Direct Download

You can also directly download a precompiled executable.

- [Linux x86 (64-bit)](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/knox/-/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/knox-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu?job=compile)
- [Linux ARM (64-bit)](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/knox/-/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/knox-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu?job=compile)
- [MacOS x86 (64-bit)](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/knox/-/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/knox-x86_64-apple-darwin?job=compile)
- [MacOS ARM (64-bit)](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/knox/-/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/knox-aarch64-apple-darwin?job=compile)
- [Windows x86 (64-bit)](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/knox/-/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/knox-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe?job=compile)

Make sure to `chmod +x` the file after downloading, and place it somewhere in your `$PATH`.

### Running with Deno

You can clone this repo, and then run `deno task knox` to run the CLI.

## Usage

```sh
knox init
knox add key alex
knox start
```

### Initialize a Bunker

To create a new `.bunker` file, run:

```sh
knox init
```

You will be prompted to enter a password. The password encrypts the bunker file, and will need to be re-entered every time you run bunker commands.

### Add a Key

```sh
knox add alex
```

Each key must have a unique nickname, like "alex" or "ditto". You will be prompted to unlock the bunker, then enter your key.

### Generate a URI

```sh
knox uri alex wss://gleasonator.dev/relay
```

Get a bunker URI you can paste into a client.

### Start the Bunker Daemon

To start the signer:

```sh
knox start
```

It will watch the `.bunker` file for changes, and update automatically whenever the file is altered.

## Design Philosophy

`knox` is a group of commands, which mainly alter an encrypted `.bunker` file. For instance, `knox add` simply modifies the bunker file.

`knox start` is a special command that starts remote signers for all the authorizations in your bunker file, and then watches the bunker file for changes.

OS file locking is used to make atomic updates to the bunker file.

## The Bunker File Format

The bunker file format uses the exact same binary format as [`NIP-49`](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/49.md), except the `plaintext` is a JSON-stringified object instead of a private key. The raw encrypted bytes (before bech32 encoding) are saved to a file with a `.bunker` extension.

The inner JSON data is structured as follows:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "name": "alex",
      "sec": "nsec1refymzcgzzy9f5ma5vvygpyt43ytqr9y95zv9vxw89zes7dd8wuq4yvu2h",
      "created_at": "2024-11-06T21:39:57.450Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "patrick",
      "sec": "nsec197hjd7f5guhv8lstrjggy2wx93neq4gqvqudzf06yyxl2hfk7nmsw9gzgl",
      "created_at": "2024-11-06T23:48:59.484Z"
    }
  ],

    {

      "secret": "bceb2671-908c-4660-aea3-613b16c9c9f9",
      "relays": ["wss://gleasonator.dev/relay"],
      "pubkeys": ["99128ae2834170f6b06f0e0415ba2ac51339273a3e415cde2864062c8c2f911d"],
      "max_uses": 1,
      "bunker_sec": "nsec1p7wvnqphnjfx4pd0kl7qzmtdz9t4nck3vvs6nlrrvh8r6sjr8zgqw8f8z7",
      "created_at": "2024-11-06T21:40:11.941Z"
    },
    {
      "key": "alex",
      "secret": "6616d4c3-5bfa-429e-aa6b-1a74d2797aa1",
      "relays": ["wss://gleasonator.dev/relay"],
      "pubkeys": [],
      "max_uses": 1,
      "bunker_sec": "nsec15e0wrhpjvfxfnafm59xdkz705jh89fv7637pn6vj3ructguew04qkkqgvs",
      "created_at": "2024-11-06T23:49:10.114Z"
    },
    {
      "key": "patrick",
      "secret": "761cb70a-5a4f-4a09-85c8-d43dc7c5b580",
      "relays": ["wss://gleasonator.dev/relay"],
      "pubkeys": [],
      "max_uses": 1,
      "bunker_sec": "nsec1s0vgxlr3lx59jtynsxkrksrre5ujfy4p0w7vrwqtxh2pswpg6f8qzxmmxq",
      "created_at": "2024-11-06T23:49:29.790Z"
    }
  ],
  "version": 1
}
```

- `keys` is an array of named nsec's with timestamps.
- `authorizations` are first generated by `bunker uri` with an empty `pubkeys` array. After a client connects, the remote pubkey gets added to the array.
- `verson` is the version of the bunker file format.
